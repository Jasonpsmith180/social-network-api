# social-network-api



## Description
It seems that every website out there has some sort of social network to allow their users to interact with one another. So I built a flexible social network api that can be adapted to any site. The api allows a user to perform all of the CRUD routes for a user and thoughts (comments) as well as add/remove friends and reactions to thoughts. The site uses express for server capabilities, mongodb for the database, and mongoose as an ORM for mongodb.

## Tests
Testing out the CRUD routes is really the only test for this project. If you have the dependecies and a database interfacing program like Insomnia installed you should be good to go!
